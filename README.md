**CHOUCHOUTER_BY_NANOU** is a Python application designed as a showcase site.  
It allows visitors to view achievements, discover services, make an appointment via a link to the booking site, and ensure loyalty tracking.

This application is intended for a nail technician with simple use.  
An administrator dashboard is also integrated to facilitate management.

This project is carried out as part of an RNCP training and will be deployed later.

> ⚠️ For now, development is optimized for a 27-inch screen.  
> Adaptation to other screen sizes is coming, so display issues may arise.
